## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

- Currently, the form is not yet functional, but I plan to implement its core functionality using JavaScript. Future updates will also include enhancing the checkbox styling for a better user experience. These improvements will ensure the form is both visually appealing and fully operational.

- Make the page responsive and create a mobile design to implement with media queries.
