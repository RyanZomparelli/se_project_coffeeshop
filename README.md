# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

Currently, the form is not yet functional, but I plan to implement its core functionality using JavaScript. Future updates will also include enhancing the checkbox styling for a better user experience. These improvements will ensure the form is both visually appealing and fully operational.
